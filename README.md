## Portal 2 In The Alien Swarm Engine
What is P2ASW?<br>
P2ASW is a free project aiming to recreate most of Portal 2's entities and functions in the ASW engine SDK.<br>
The source code is available in this repository, and is based on leaked Portal & CSGO code and reverse engineered code.<br>

P2ASW is **not** finished, certain features/entities might not exist or work properly. 

## Contributing
Anyone is free to contribute to the project!

## Building
### Windows
Follow the instructions [here](https://developer.valvesoftware.com/wiki/Source_SDK_2013) for setting up Visual Studio 2013.<br>
Once complete, clone the repo and execute `creategameprojects.bat` inside `src\` to generate the Visual Studio project.<br>
Open the newly created `game.sln` and have fun!
### Linux/MacOS are not officially tested. If anyone has succeeded in building for either platform, please open a PR stating how.

## Installing/Running the mod
1. Download Alien Swarm [here](http://store.steampowered.com/app/630/) and Portal 2 [here](https://store.steampowered.com/app/620/Portal_2).<br>
### YOU MUST OWN PORTAL 2 ON STEAM TO USE P2ASW.
2. Copy the `portal2asw` folder from `game\` into your SourceMods folder and restart Steam.<br>
The mod should now show up in your Steam library.<br>
You must compile the DLL's yourself. P2ASW is not a game, it is an SDK.
